1. [2 Points] Display a "classroom" with a floor plane and a blackboard on a planar wall parallel to the x-y plane (perpendicular to the floor). 
- assignment2.js line 205 - 210 

2. [2 Points] Display the spline on the blackboard. You can either display the spline from the beginning or gradually display it during the drawing animation.
- assignment2.js line 66 - 91

3. [4 Points] Model the human character using ellipsoids (you can use the Sphere primitive with non-uniform scaling).
- human.js line 22 - 77

4. [8 Points] Implement the inverse kinematics solver using the pseudoinverse approach.
- human.js line 166 

5. [1 Point] Move the right hand from its initial position such that the end effector touches the board (initial animation).
- assignment2.js line 143 - 154 

6. [3 Points] Then, move the hand to draw the spline, looping repeatedly, since the spline is a closed shape.
- assignment2.js line 143 - 154
